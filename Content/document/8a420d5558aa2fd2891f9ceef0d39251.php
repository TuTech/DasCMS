Innovative
research and technological development holds the key to making Europe “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based
economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic with more and better jobs
and greater social cohesion.”<sup>1</sup> 
</p><p class="bodytext">
Clearly,
research cannot be carried out without researchers, and it has been estimated
that Europe will need to train some 700,000
additional scientists in the coming years if it is to compete with other global
players in research and technological development. With changing and evolving
demands on society and the economy, researchers is the future are likely to
find themselves employed in areas not directly related to their field of
study, and&nbsp; will use their research training in many different capacities over their careers.
Employers seek people who are not only highly trained, but also highly
adaptable and mobile, able to function effectively in a variety of different
contexts – both academic and commercially oriented – during their professional
careers.

For both
those wishing to establish a research career, or those who wish to use
a PhD
qualification in other contexts, learning about research funding,
knowledge
management and exploitation as well as academic entrepreneurship are
now
considered essential “generic” skills training. Although many PhD
programmes
now recognise this and offer some provision for training, the
availability of transferable skills training throughout Europe is very
uneven. 

</p><p class="bodytext">

The ReMaT project
aims to open up access to transferable skills training and encourage a
much
wider availability and broader take up. This is to be achieved by
providing a
pilot programme to introduce research and knowledge management skills
to PhD candidates in the life sciences. ReMaT workshops have been
developed by
individuals and organisations with many years of practical experience
from
academia and industry. The workshops are
initially being offered in four locations throughout Europe and are open to PhD
students from Europe sent by their host
organisation for the purpose of encouraging institutions to develop similar schemes.
