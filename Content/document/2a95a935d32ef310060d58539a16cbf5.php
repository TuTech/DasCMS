    ReMaT represents a
    new programme of research management training for PhD students and early-career
    researchers. Developed with EU Framework 6 funding, the project aims to add
    value to existing bioscience doctoral training programmes across the European
    Higher Education Area. While the European Universities Association identifies
    
        structured doctoral degree programmes as the best
        way to educate students to meet the multiple challenges of the knowledge
        society, there is an increasing need for complementary research management
        skills training.

    <p class="bodytext">
The ReMaT project is based on a study of doctoral training programmes
from across Europe and focus groups with PhD students, to identify
the strengths and weakness of existing training programmes. On the basis of
this research the intensive two-day ReMaT workshop has been developed to
strengthen existing training programmes, focusing on research and
commercially based management skills training. The dates and locations
of the pilot workshops are: </p><br />

        The success of the
        ReMaT project and the two-day workshops depends on working with
        universities and departments across
            Europe and the willingness of faculty and students to participate. Building on the
        pilot, the intention is to develop ReMaT in association with universities so it
        can be integrated into existing doctoral training programmes to enhance
        complementary skills-based research management training in European
        universities. Institutions interested in hosting a ReMaT workshop are invited to email
