ReMaT aims to provide research management training for the next generation
of Europe's scientists by <b>developing and establishing training
courses and materials</b> in research project management
suitable to the needs of doctoral students. There is a lack of
training opportunities currently available to the Ph.D. students.
ReMaT will develop a set of training modules for doctoral candidates
in the life science that will introduce them to management and
exploitation issues related to conducting research at a European
level and assess their effectiveness for PhD programme design. Among
the topics to be addressed are European research funding,
international collaborative research projects, IPR and legal issues,
specific issues of ethics and clinical practice relating to research
projects in the life sciences as well as exploitation issues and
knowledge transfer. The project partners will develop the course 
materials and adapt them to fit the current needs and situation of
European doctoral students in a pilot series of workshops.
</p>
<p>
ReMaT thus directly supports young scientists who want to develop management skills for scientific and innovation management for their
future careers and focuses specifically on the needs and level of
experience of early-stage researchers.
</p>
<p>
The project will contribute to enhancing the ability of the next
generation of leading researchers to take advantage of European
funding opportunities, work more effectively in collaborative
European research projects and exploit the knowledge produced by
research project by helping them to acquire the skills and
competences they need to carry out research projects independently at
an early stage of their scientific careers. The project partners will
continue to use the course material developed in ReMaT to conduct
future workshops on science and innovation management and expand
outreach to the target group of doctoral students at universities and
research institutions throughout Europe.</p><br />
