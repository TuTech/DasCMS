"It was only during the workshop that I have realised how much research
management is important. I have never had this kind of training."
(Nives Skunca, PhD candidate in Zagreb, Croatia)
<br />
<br />
“There 
was a good atmosphere in the workshop, the lecturers were really professional 
(by their experience, knowledge and the way of presenting things).” (Meri 
Kokkonen, PhD candidate, Finland)<br />
<br />
"I liked a lot this workshop. I didn't come as complete "tabula&nbsp;rasa" but 
this new information put some new enthusiasm/curiosity in&nbsp;my way of looking on 
professional life." (Dragomira Majhen,&nbsp;PhDcandidate in Zagreb, Croatia)<br />
<br />
"You can work as much as you can but if you don't know how to&nbsp;present it to 
commission you just stay on the level you're on - for&nbsp;high level of research you 
need to make group of people (various&nbsp;preferations and skills), find money and 
bring your brilliant idea&nbsp;to end!" (Josipa Vlainic, Zagreb, Croatia)<br />

interactions….Very good organized!!!! Good speakers! Nice atmosphere. Workshop should
be longer. There was no enough time for discussions.” (Marko Pe<span style="" lang="EN-GB">tek, PhD
