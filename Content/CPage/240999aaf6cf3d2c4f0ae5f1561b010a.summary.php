    ReMaT aims to provide research management training for the next generation
    of Europe's scientists by
    <b>
        developing and establishing training
        courses and materials
    </b>
    in research project management
    suitable to the needs of doctoral students. There is a lack of
    training opportunities currently available to the Ph.D. students.
    ReMaT will develop a set of training modules for doctoral candidates
    in the life science that will introduce them to management and
    exploitation issues related to conducting research at a European
    level and assess their effectiveness for PhD programme design. Among
    the topics to be addressed are European research funding,
    international collaborative research projects, IPR and legal issues,
    specific issues of ethics and clinical practice relating to research
    projects in the life sciences as well as exploitation issues and
    knowledge transfer. The project partners will develop the course 
    materials and adapt them to fit the current needs and situation of
    European doctoral students in a pilot series of workshops.
