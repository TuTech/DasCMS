The intensive
workshops have been designed to offer an introduction to research management
through a series of interactive modules on complementary skills-based training.
Staged over two days, the interactive pilot workshops are open to PhD students
from across Europe, and will provide an excellent networking opportunity in
addition to the training programme itself.
