    Innovative
    research and technological development holds the key to making Europe “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based
    economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic with more and better jobs
    and greater social cohesion.”

    Clearly,
    research cannot be carried out without researchers, and it has been estimated
    that Europe will need to train some 700,000
    additional scientists in the coming years if it is to compete with other global
    players in research and technological development. With changing and evolving
    demands on society and the economy, researchers is the future are likely to
    find themselves employed in areas not directly related to their field of
    study, and&nbsp; will use their research training in many different capacities over their careers.
    Employers seek people who are not only highly trained, but also highly
    adaptable and mobile, able to function effectively in a variety of different
    contexts – both academic and commercially oriented – during their professional
    careers.

    For both
    those wishing to establish a research career, or those who wish to use
    a PhD
    qualification in other contexts, learning about research funding,
    knowledge
    management and exploitation as well as academic entrepreneurship are
    now
    considered essential “generic” skills training. Although many PhD
    programmes
    now recognise this and offer some provision for training, the
    availability of transferable skills training throughout Europe is very
    uneven. 
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    The ReMaT project
    aims to open up access to transferable skills training and encourage a
    much
    wider availability and broader take up. This is to be achieved by
    providing a
    pilot programme to introduce research and knowledge management skills
    to PhD candidates in the life sciences. ReMaT workshops have been
    developed by
    individuals and organisations with many years of practical experience
    from
    academia and industry. The workshops are
    initially being offered in four locations throughout Europe and are open to PhD
    students from Europe sent by their host
    organisation for the purpose of encouraging institutions to develop similar schemes.
