    ReMaT represents a
    new programme of research management training for PhD students and early-career
    researchers. Developed with EU Framework 6 funding, the project aims to add
    value to existing bioscience doctoral training programmes across the European
    Higher Education Area. While the European Universities Association identifies
    
        structured doctoral degree programmes as the best
        way to educate students to meet the multiple challenges of the knowledge
        society, there is an increasing need for complementary research management
        skills training.
